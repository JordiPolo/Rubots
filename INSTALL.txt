Currently the code is divided in two modules:

Rubots
RRMi 

RRMi depends on 
Gazebo SVN
Gazebo Ruby bindings

optionally:
Player SVN
Player ruby bindings


Rubots depends only on RRMi and YAML

To get Gazebo, Player and their Ruby bindings:

1.- svn:
Instructions here:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/playerstage/develop
 You need to compile and install Gazebo (not other software of the project).

Gazebo depends on Ogre 1.6 and on ode 0.11 that may not be in the repositories of your 
distribution. Sound and other alternative functionality of Gazebois not needed currently by Rubots.


2.- Ubuntu Karmic / Debian Sid repository:
https://launchpad.net/~thjc/+archive/ppa

WARNING: the ppa repository have not updated yet to the needed versions for Rubots!
It may soon...

Any problem compiling those programs, you can report here, I will solve it or send them
"upstream" if necessary.
