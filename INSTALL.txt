Rubots depends on:
- Player 3.0 and its Ruby bindings 
- Gazebo 0.9 

As those versions are yet to be released, only two methods are available to get them:

1.- svn:
Instructions here:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/playerstage/develop
 You need to compile and install Player and Gazebo (not other software of the project).

Player comes with looots of drivers, you dont need to install them all, only make sure 
the Ruby bindings got compiled and installed.  

Gazebo depends on Ogre 1.6 and on ode 0.11 that may not be in the repositories of your 
distribution. Also, sound and other alternative functionality is not needed currently.


2.- Ubuntu Karmic / Debian Sid repository:
https://launchpad.net/~thjc/+archive/ppa


Any problem compiling those programs, you can report here, I will solve it or send them
"upstream" if necessary.
