Currently the code is divided in two modules:

Rubots
RRMi 

RRMi depends on 
Gazebo SVN
Player SVN
Player ruby bindings

Rubots depends on RRMi and Korundum (KDE Ruby bindings)

To get Gazebo, Player and their Ruby bindings:

1.- svn:
Instructions here:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/playerstage/develop
 You need to compile and install Gazebo (not other software of the project).

Gazebo depends on Ogre >=1.6.1 and on ode >= 0.10 that may not be in the repositories of your 
distribution. OpenAL and other alternative functionality of Gazebo is not used currently by Rubots.


2.- Ubuntu Karmic / Debian Sid repository:
https://launchpad.net/~thjc/+archive/ppa

WARNING: the ppa repository have not updated yet to the versions needed for Rubots!
It may soon...

Any problem compiling those programs, you can report here, I will solve it or send them
"upstream" if necessary.
